# munin3
This is a KICAD version of the Munin 3 100W amplifer designed by Kjell - LA2NI. Note that some of the DNI parts have been left out of the schematic. 

The design has been updated to the point that it reliably can balance the two transistors. Haven't verified the
Test Point for that operation yet.

Kjell, LA2NI has reviewed the design and found an error on my part when I did flooding of the power 
transformer.  Kicad didn't really do what I expected. I had to beef up these connections by hand. He also
found a couple errors in my schematic, and I found another later.. these issues have all been 
fixed.

I have NOT verified that the amp operates though - stay tuned.
